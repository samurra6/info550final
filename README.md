# project description

The Indicators of Heart Disease report contains an initial descriptive analysis of the data which includes a descriptive analysis table (Table 1) and a figure (Figure 1) showing the distribution of an indicator variable (BMI) stratified by heart disease status. Additionally, the report includes a basic initial logistic regression to assess whether the chosen variables of interest -  BMI, sex, race, smoking status, and asthma status - have a significant association with heart disease outcomes, the results of which are shown in Table 2.

`final_repo/`
  - contains all code and output related to the project
  
`final_repo/code/01maketable1.R`
  - produces table1
  - saves table1 as a `.rds` object in `output/` folder
  
`final_repo/code/02makefigure.R`
  - produces figure
  - saves figure as a `.png` in `output/` folder

`final_repo/code/03maketable2.R`
  - produces table2
  - saves table2 as a `.rds` object in `output/` folder

`final_repo/code/04render.R`
  - is used for rendering the final report `final.Rmd` from the command line 

`final.Rmd`
- reads two tables and figure generated by `code/01maketable1.R`, `code/02makefigure.R`, and `code/03maketable2.R`

The Makefile is used to produce table1, figure, table2, and render the final report `final.Rmd`from the command line. This can be done using the "make" command.
